# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to help prepare for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age. 
## Results
There are four major talking points for this analysis:

- As seen in the image below of the retirement titles table, there are already several employees that have different titles as they have been promoted over the years just within the first ten rows. The duplicate employee numbers had to be removed to further the analysis but it shows that good employees were rewarded for their hard work through promotions.

- There are two things of mention about the image below regarding retiring titles by count. The first thing to mention is that the amount of senior roles retiring compared to their non-senior counterparts is significantly more. For senior to non-senior engineer roles there is about two and a half times the amount retiring and for senior to non-senior staff, there is about three and a half times the amount of people retiring. 
- The second talking point is a build-off of the last two talking points in that with such a large portion of the people retiring being in a senior role, will the remaining employees have the capability to step up into those senior roles? Generally, the responsibilities and difficulties of a senior position is far and above that of a non-senior role. This is the very reason mentorship eligibility needed to be determined in the second part of the analysis, so this gap can be filled efficiently.

- The last talking point is that at a quick glance of the first ten rows of the image below, regarding mentorship eligibility, that most employees that are eligible for mentorship are in senior roles. Building off previous points made, with a large number of senior employees leaving the company, they will need plenty of senior employees to mentor potential new senior employees. In the case of non-senior roles being filled, both senior and non senior employees within a department could provide mentorship.

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

</p>

As seen in the image above, additional queries were done to find the total number of employees (300,024) and the total number of retiring employees (72,458). The total number of employees retiring accounts for nearly 25% of the current total employees which is a significant amount of roles to be filled. 

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
